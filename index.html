         <h3>War: Classic Card Game</h3>
         <h4>Author: Patrick Murray</h4>
         <p>
            <a href="./tests.html"><h3>Load Test Results</h3></a>
         </p>

         <h3>Instructions:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>
               In Visual Studio Code, write the code that accomplishes the
               objectives listed below and ensures that the code compiles and
               runs as directed.
            </li>
            <li>
               Create a new repository on GitHub for this week's assignments and
               push this document, with your project code, to the repository.
            </li>
            <li>
               Include the URLs for this week's repository and video where
               instructed.
            </li>
            <li>Submit this document as a .PDF file in the LMS.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Coding Steps:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>
               For the final project you will be creating an automated version
               of the classic card game <span class="italic">WAR!</span> There
               are many versions of the game <span class="italic">WAR</span>. In
               this version there are only 2 players.
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     You do not need to do anything special when there is a tie
                     in a round.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               Think about how you would build this project and write your plan
               down. Consider classes such as: <span class="bold">Card</span>,
               <span class="bold">Deck</span>, <span class="bold">Player</span>,
               as well as what <span class="bold">properties</span> and
               <span class="bold">methods</span> they may include.
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     You do not need to accept any user input, when you run your
                     code, the entire game should play out instantly without any
                     user input inside of your browser's console.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>The completed project should, when executed, do the following:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Deal 26 Cards to each Player from a Deck of 52 cards.</li>
            <li>Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card.</li>
            <li>The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Ties result in zero points for both Players.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
               After all cards have been played, display the score and declare
               the winner.
            </li>
            <li>
               Write a Unit Test using Mocha and Chai for at least one of the
               functions you write.
            </li>
         </ul>
