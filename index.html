            as directed.
         </li>
         <li>
            Create a new repository on GitHub for this week's assignments and
            push this document, with your project code, to the repository. â€¢
            Include the URLs for this week's repository and video where
            instructed.
         </li>
         <li>Submit this document as a .PDF file in the LMS.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Coding Steps:</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>
            For the final project you will be creating an automated version of
            the classic card game WAR! There are many versions of the game WAR.
            In this version there are only 2 players.
            <ul>
               <li>
                  You do not need to do anything special when there is a tie in
                  a round.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            Think about how you would build this project and write your plan
            down. Consider classes such as: Card, Deck, Player, as well as what
            properties and methods they may include.
            <ul>
               <li>
                  You do not need to accept any user input, when you run your
                  code, the entire game should play out instantly without any
                  user input inside of your browser's console.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The completed project should, when executed, do the following:</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Deal 26 Cards to each Player from a Deck of 52 cards. 
            <li>
            Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card.</li>
         </li>
         <li>The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point</li>
         <ul>
            <li>Ties result in zero points for both Players.</li>
         </ul>
         <li>
            After all cards have been played, display the score and declare the
            winner.
         </li>
         <li>
            Write a Unit Test using Mocha and Chai for at least one of the
            functions you write.
         </li>
      </ul>
